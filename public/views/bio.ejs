                I have acquired a comprehensive set of web development skills through self directed study and personal projects. My proficiency 
                includes front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with experience using popular frameworks and libraries like 
                React and Bootstrap. On the back end, I am most skilled in server-side programming with Node.js and Express, as well as some familiarity with Python. I 
                have a solid understanding of database management using MySQL and MongoDB. Additionally, I am adept at creating responsive and user-friendly web applications,

                specialized in analog and digital communication technologies, with a focus on RF Networks, and developed intermediate-level 
                computer skills and troubleshooting techniques. My technical knowledge expanded through personal study and practice in web app 
                development.

        <p class="bio-text">
            My journey in sales began as a teenager, honed through frontline customer interactions and attending an 
            evangelical church. This foundation was further refined through years of customer service and specific job responsibilities. 
            My selling ability has been indispensable in every role I have undertaken, enabling me to excel in various environments.

        <h3 class="bio-sub">Class A CDL</h3>
        <p class="bio-text">
            With twelve years of over-the-road (OTR) experience, I have traversed all 48 continental US states and parts of Canada, driving through 
            diverse terrains and weather conditions without any accidents. I have handled various types of trailers, including reefers, box, flatbed, 
            RGN, lowboy, and grain hoppers, often transporting over-dimensional loads. This experience has also cultivated a strong ability to work 
            independently with minimal supervision.
